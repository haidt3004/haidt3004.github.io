        <li><strong>Data Controller:</strong> Google LLC, 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA 94043, USA</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>

    <h3>Local Storage</h3>

        <li>Data persists until you uninstall the game or clear app data</li>
        <li>No personal information is stored</li>
    </ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
    <p>TAP PERFECT 2D is designed to be age-appropriate for all users, including children under 13 years of age. Our
        Application complies with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>No account registration or authentication is required</li>
        <li>No personally identifiable information is collected from any user</li>
        <li>Advertising content displayed to users in applicable jurisdictions is non-personalized and contextual</li>
        <li>No behavioral tracking or profiling of minor users is conducted</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Parents and guardians with questions or concerns regarding children's privacy may contact us using the
        information provided in Section "Contact Information".</p>

    <h2>User Rights and Controls</h2>
    <p>Users maintain the following rights regarding their data:</p>

    <h3>1. Data Modification and Deletion</h3>
    <p>Local application data may be reset or deleted through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Application data clearing via device settings</li>
        <li>Complete application uninstallation</li>
        <li>In-application reset functions (where available)</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Local data deletion is irreversible and will result in permanent loss of progress, scores,
        and preferences.</p>

    <h3>2. Advertising Preferences</h3>
    <p>Users may opt out of personalized advertising through platform-specific controls:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>iOS/iPadOS Devices:</strong> Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking &gt; [Disable "Allow
            Apps to Request to Track"]</li>
        <li><strong>Android Devices:</strong> Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Delete advertising ID / Opt out of Ads
            Personalization</li>
        <li><strong>Web Browsers:</strong> Browser privacy settings, cookie controls, or third-party privacy extensions
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Opting out of personalized advertising does not eliminate advertisements entirely but limits behavioral
        targeting. The Application will continue to display contextual advertisements to support its free-to-play model.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Data Portability</h3>
    <p>As the Application does not collect personally identifiable information or maintain user accounts, data
        portability rights are not applicable.</p>

    <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
    <p>If you play TAP PERFECT 2D from outside the United States, your information may be transferred to and processed
        in the United States where our third-party service providers (Google Firebase, AdMob) operate servers. By using
        the game, you consent to this transfer.</p>

    <h2>Policy Modifications</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time to reflect changes in our data practices, legal
        requirements, or business operations. Material changes will be indicated by updating the "Last Updated" date at
        the beginning of this document.</p>
    <p>Users are responsible for periodically reviewing this Privacy Policy. Continued use of the Application following
        the posting of changes constitutes acceptance of those modifications. If you do not agree to modified terms, you
        must discontinue use of the Application.</p>

    <h2>Do Not Track Signals</h2>
    <p>Some browsers and devices offer "Do Not Track" signals. We do not currently respond to these signals as there is
        no industry standard for compliance. Our minimal data collection practices align with privacy-conscious
        approaches regardless of DNT settings.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Data:</strong> Retained until app uninstallation or data clearing</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Data:</strong> Retained for 14 months, then automatically deleted (Firebase default)</li>
        <li><strong>Ad Data:</strong> Retained according to Google AdMob policies (typically 90 days)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Jurisdiction-Specific Rights</h2>

    <h3>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</h3>
    <p>California residents have the following rights under CCPA:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Right to Know:</strong> You may request disclosure of the categories and specific pieces of personal
            information we collect.</li>

        <li><strong>Non-Discrimination:</strong> We will not discriminate against you for exercising your CCPA rights.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Given that our Application does not collect personally identifiable information, most CCPA requests will return
        null results. To exercise these rights, contact us using the information in Section "Contact Information".</p>
